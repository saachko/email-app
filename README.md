## Usage

At the start user have to enter his name (just name without password or anything). After entering the name user get to the MailPage, where he can send a new message to any user of this app (also he can send a message to someone who didn't log in and that way create a new user). The current user can see all the messages he has sent or received. All messages are stored in database forever. So, if somebody uses the same name, they will see all corresponding messages. Users can send message to themselves.
